        <h1>Ghanian Akan Names</h1>
        <p>
          The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day
          of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.<br />
          These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
          character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety
          and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's
          middle name.
        </p>
        <p>
          This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African
          diaspora. During the 18thâ€“19th centuries, enslaved people in the
          Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred to as
          <strong>Coromantees.</strong> Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had
          "day names" including <em>Cuffy, Cuffee</em> or <em>Kofi, Cudjoe</em> or <em>Kojo, Quao</em> or
          <em>Quaw,</em> and <em>Quamina </em>or <em>Kwame/Kwamina.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they
          also have an English or Christian name.<br />
          Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president <strong>Kwame
          Nkrumah</strong> and former United Nations Secretary-General <strong>Kofi Annan.</strong>
